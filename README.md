# bay-scraper-lambda
An AWS Lambda-compatible version of the bay-scraper script

An alternate version of the bay-scraper script found on [Github](https://github.com/donaldsimmons/scripts/). The original was formatted to be run either manually or via cron on a local machine. This version is instead designed to run using AWS Lambda.

As such, this version of the script won't be built to use various command line options and usability considerations. Instead, this script is designed to run using a set number of query terms and other options.
